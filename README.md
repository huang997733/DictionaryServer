# DictionaryServer
This project is to implement a multi-threaded Dictionary Server using a client-server architecture. The system allows multiple clients to connect concurrently. Clients can do four types of operations which are querying a word from dictionary, adding a word and its meanings to the dictionary, removing a word from the dictionary and update an existing word in the dictionary.
